# Design
This file is about the design process, from our first designs to other modifications.

## Original Design

### Step One: Measurements
First, you want to measure all the items that will be placed inside the car. This includes the Raspberry Pi, the battery pack, the motors, and cables. Make sure there is space for everything.

### Step Two: Create Design
The origianal and modified designs are rectangular, made to fit all the items.
