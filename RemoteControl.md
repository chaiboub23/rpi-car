# Remote Control

Controlling the Raspberry Pi wirelessly is done using ssh. Using another Raspberry Pi, you can ssh using WIFI.

First, ssh into the local Raspberry Pi to get access to the MyRNS WIFI.
```
ssh pi@raspberrypi03.local
```
Next, ssh with ip address of the Raspberry Pi.
```
ssh pi@10.40.11.241
```
Then you can move on to running the python files on the car's Raspberry Pi.
